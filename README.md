# btmat
Arduino-based project to interface an Android device with stackmats and other competition timers. It handles the decoding of timer signals from the audio jack and transmits the decoded string via serial bluetooth.

Assemble the hardware according to the schematics. A full tutorial will be up shortly. Instructions given below are for the software only.

Search for the bluetooth module from an Android device and pair with it. Use a bluetooth terminal app to verify if the time on the stackmat is being transmitted. Use the apk of the plusTimer fork on my github to connect with the arduino.
